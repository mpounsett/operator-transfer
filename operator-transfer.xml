<abstract>
<t>Section 4.3.5.1 of <xref target="RFC6781"/> &quot;DNSSEC Operational Practices, version 2&quot;
describes a procedure for transitioning a DNSSEC signed zone from one
(cooperative) operator to another.  The procedure works well in many
situations, but makes the assumption that it is feasible for the two operators
to simultaneously publish slightly different versions of the zone being
transferred.  In some cases, such as with TLD registries, operational
considerations require both operators to publish identical versions of the
zone for the duration of the transition.  This document describes a modified
transition procedure which can be used in these cases.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The process described in &quot;DNSSEC Operational Practices, version 2&quot;
(<xref target="RFC6781"/>), section 4.3.5.1 for cooperating DNS operators to move a DNSSEC
signed zone cannot be followed in all cases.  When operators are moving a zone
that is automatically published and/or changes rapidly, such as with a TLD or
any other zone published from a registration database, it may not be feasible
for the operators to publish different versions of the same zone.
</t>
<t>In these cases, it would be necessary for one or both operators to have the
capability to add, remove, or alter arbitrary records inline along the zone
transfer path (such as modifying the NSSet, and stripping RRSIGs).  It cannot
be assumed that this capability exists, since few (if any) common DNS
implementations include these functions, and many custom implementations exist
whose feature sets cannot be predicted.
</t>
<t>As a result, it must be assumed that operators moving an automatically
generated or frequently updated zone must be able to publish an identical zone
while transitioning it from one operator to another.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="changing-between-cooperating-dns-operators" title="Changing Between Cooperating DNS Operators">

<section anchor="assumptions" title="Assumptions">
<t>In this scenario, it is assumed that the operators will not exchange any
private key material, but are otherwise fully cooperative.  It is also assumed
that the zone publishing process will be transferred between operators
independently of the DNS operations.  The simplest case is to transition the
publishing process after the DNS operations move has been completed, and is
the order that is assumed in this document, although the reverse order is
possible.  During the transition, the losing operator will provide the zone
contents to the gaining operator by some automatic means (typically zone
transfer).  The transition of the publishing process is out of scope of this
document.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="procedure-overview" title="Procedure Overview">
<t>The DNS operations transition uses a modified pre-publish KSK and ZSK
rollover, whereby the losing operator pre-publishes the public KSK and ZSK of
the gaining operator.  Part way through the transition, the losing operator
stops signing the zone and begins providing an unsecure zone to the gaining
operator, who begins signing.  Once that is done, the gaining operator
continues to post-publish the public keys of the losing operator until the
TTLs of the original RRSIGs expire.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="procedure-notation" title="Procedure Notation">
<t>In the timeline below, the losing operator is operator A, and the gaining
operator is operator B.  Records representing data generated by each operator
are appended with the operator letter.  DNSKEY records are appended with the
keytype;  DNSKEY_Z is a ZSK, and DNSKEY_K is a KSK.  RRSIGs are appended with
the DNSKEY type they were generated from, as well as the operator who
generated them; RRSIGs include in parentheses the RRSET type that they sign.
For example, RRSIG_Z_A(SOA) is the RRSIG generated with DNSKEY_Z_A and signs
the SOA record.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="the-procedure" title="The Procedure">
<t>The KSK and ZSK rollover from the losing to gaining operator keys involves six
stages as described in <xref target="Steps13"/> and <xref target="Steps46"/>.

<t hangText="Initial">
<vspace />
The initial version of the zone.  This zone is published and signed by the
losing operator.  During this stage the gaining operator should begin
serving the zone on its name servers.</t>
<t hangText="Pre-Publish">
<vspace />
Operator A begins pre-publishing DNSKEY_K_B and DNSKEY_Z_B.  At the same
time, the NS set at the apex of the zone is changed to NS_B to begin moving
traffic to the gaining name servers.  The operators MUST wait at least the
time it takes for the data to propagate to all authoritative servers plus
the TTL of the DNSKEY set before the Signing Migration step can be begun.</t>
<t hangText="Re-Delegation">
<vspace />
The parent changes the prent NS set to be NS_B, to match the NS set at the
apex of the child zone.  The parent also begins publishing the DS record for
the gaining operator.  The operators MUST wait at least the time it takes
for the data to propagate to all the parent servers plus the TTL of the DS
set before the Signing Migration step can be begun.</t>

<t hangText="Signing Migration">
<vspace />
Once the new (pre-published) DNSKEY records and DS_B are in the caches of
validating clients the operators can swap signing duties; RRSIG_K_B and
RRSIG_Z_B become the active signing keys.  When the ganinig operator begins
signing the zone, either they MUST strip the RRSIGs of the losing operator,
or the losing operator MUST begin producing an unsigned zone.  The operators
MUST wait at least the largest TTL of any RRSIG in the zone before moving on
to the Old DS Removal step.</t>
<t hangText="Old DS Removal">
<vspace />
The parent now removes the old DS_A from its zone.  The operators MUST wait
at least the TTL of the DS set before moving on to the Post Migration step.</t>
<t hangText="Post Migration">
<vspace />
After the old DS set has expired from caches the gaining operator may remove
the losing operator DNSKEYs from the zone.  At this time it is assumed that
the gaining operator severs whatever process was transferring zone data from
the losing operator, and the gaining operator begins publishing the zone.</t>
